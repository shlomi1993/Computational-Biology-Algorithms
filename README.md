# Computational-Biology-Algorithms
This repo documents implementations of algorithms I learned in a computational biology course. The database includes three parts. One is a program that allows identifying conditions for the spread of an epidemic, the second is the implementation of a Self Organizing Map network and the third deals with the implementation of biological algorithms
